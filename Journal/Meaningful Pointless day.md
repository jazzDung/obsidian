Hello, my prettiest girlfriend

First of all, sorry for not being present much (or even being present at all?) today, I slept too much, and couldn't get anything done.

I did notice that we have been together for 5 months, seriously the best 5 months I have had in a long time, I enjoy your company and looking forward to us spending much more time together (Geographically together).

About today schedules, I'm thinking that I won't rush to work immediately, instead revise my long term plan (Not having any dramatic changes, just to see if everything is still on track and feasible), design next week plan. Oh and I've just worked out, had a shower, skincared (early, I know, that deserve a praise ^^) and trimmed my nails. 

A refresh for my mind, and my body, so that mean the only thing left to do is to clean the room.

This document seem kind of dumb, but I noticed that I tend to isolate myself to work on issues when they appear, leave you wondering why did I vanished from the surface of the earth, so I'm letting you know what is going through my mind.

I can't say that I miss you, I was busy being grumpy at myself for sleeping. But after finishing the chores, schedules, and decluttering my brain, the first person I think about will be you, and you only.

Sincerely,
Your lover
