Three self-doubt mind pits that limit confidence:



[2:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUdiyhiyVVc&t=151s)

Failure to Launch (the knowing-doing trap), rumination and overthinking.

-   "What if I fail?", "What if I'm underqualified?", "What if I've missed something?"

Treading Water (failing to finish what we start).

-   Hesitation, losing interest, seeking greener grass, getting bored.

Destination Obsession

-   You set an exciting goal; put in the work & discipline to achieve it. Only to derive a short burst of pleasure, followed by a lack of fulfilment. So you immediately set the next goal.
    
-   Feeling like you've never done enough.

# How do you free yourself and avoid falling in?

Failure to Launch

-   Shift your internal narrative (inner/mental chatter).

Next time you catch yourself thinking: "I can't do this." => redirect to "How could I make this happen?"

-   Shift "I should do this" or "I have to do that" to: "I get to do this" or "I choose to do that".
    
-   Instead of combating disempowering thoughts, redirect your mind to empowering language that reflects personal control.

-   Finally, move from "why" to "what": instead of "Why don't I feel motivated?" ask yourself "What can I do to get excited about getting this done?"

It's vital that the reframing is immediately followed by action!

Treading Water

-   If you find yourself stuck in this mind pit, schedule time to reflect on WHY you're doing what you're doing. ("For the sake of what?")

Destination Obsession

-   When you're aware of this unhealthy doubt-driven behavior, remind yourself of the irrefutable truths that:
    
    > You are not your work.
    
    > Your worth is not entirely a reflection of your achievements.
    
    and
    
    > You're not going to find lasting contentment on the hedonic treadmill of achievement.
    
-   Instead, set boundaries for yourself.
    

Lastly, if you notice yourself feeling inadequate due to comparing your current reality to someone else's? Shift the narrative. Say: "I'm happy for this person. What can I learn from their Journey?"

You can unlearn [self-doubt] through creating new, healthier habits and tapping into the power of neuroplasticity that rewires your brain.
