Factless fact tables are a type of data structure that can be used in data warehouse design to capture events or conditions that do not have any associated measures or facts. They are only used to establish relationships between elements of different dimensions and are also useful for describing events and coverage, meaning tables contain information that nothing has happened[1](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-benefits-challenges-using-factless-fact-tables)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factless-fact-table/).

Factless fact tables can provide several benefits when it comes to data warehouse design and analysis. For example, they can simplify the data model by reducing the number of dimensions and facts to create and maintain[1](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-benefits-challenges-using-factless-fact-tables). Factless fact tables describe events or activities and can be used to capture events or situations that have no measurable outcome but are important for analysis[3](https://dwgeek.com/data-warehouse-fact-less-fact-examples.html/). [For example, you can use a factless fact table to record student attendance, product promotions, or customer visits](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-benefits-challenges-using-factless-fact-tables)[1](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-benefits-challenges-using-factless-fact-tables).

Factless fact tables can also be used to analyze what didn’t happen. [These queries always have two parts: a factless coverage table that contains all the possibilities of events that might happen and an activity table that contains the events that did happen](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-benefits-challenges-using-factless-fact-tables)[1](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-benefits-challenges-using-factless-fact-tables)[4](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/7107/factless-fact-table-sql-server-data-warehouse/).
